//3. What is the difference between OOP and POP?

1. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):
Focus: Organizes code around objects that represent real-world entities.
Key Concepts: Class, Object, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
Code Reusability: High, due to inheritance and modular design.
Data: Data is more secure due to encapsulation (data hiding).
Examples: C++, Java, Python (supports both OOP and POP).
2. POP (Procedural-Oriented Programming):
Focus: Organizes code around procedures or functions that operate on data.
Key Concepts: Functions, Procedure calls, and Flow of control.
Code Reusability: Lower, as functions are independent and less modular.
Data: Data is less secure since functions share global data and variables.
Examples: C, Pascal.
