// 2. What is OOP? List OOP concepts
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming model that organizes software design around objects, which contain data (attributes) and methods (functions). OOP helps make code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

 OOP Concepts:
Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors an object can have.

Object: An instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with unique data and can perform actions (methods).

Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and controlling access to the data (data hiding).

Abstraction: Hiding complex details and showing only the necessary parts. Focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.

Inheritance: A class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse and a hierarchical relationship.

Polymorphism: The ability of objects to behave in different ways based on their class. It can be achieved by method overloading or overriding.
